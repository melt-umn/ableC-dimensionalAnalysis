# This script runs Silver on the grammar that performs the modular
# determinism analysis.  A fair amount of information is displayed to
# the screen, so look for the "copper_mda:" task in the output.  There
# should be a line reading "Modular determinism analysis passed." that
# indicates that the analysis was successful.
